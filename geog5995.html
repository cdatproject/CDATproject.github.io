						<p>This module consisted of a series of practicals (1-8) leading to the develoment of a Python
						agent based model. This model was based on an agents moving and interacting in an environment.
						In each of the stages extra features have been added. Some of these features have not been included
						in the final model. To see the code for these features please look at the appropiate practical code
						I have listed below what was covered in each practical.
						<ul>
						<li><b>practical1_model.py - </b>	Makes 2 agents Moves 2 agents num_of_iterations iterations calculates distance betwen 2 agents</li>
						<li><b>practical2_model.py - </b>	Creates agent list, with coordinates generated randomly for num_of_agents agents Uses indexed list referencing Plots 2 agent final positions using Matplotlib ****EXTRA - plots most easterly point red</li>
						<li><b>practical3_model.py - </b>	Shrinks code to move num_of_agents agents Implements torus solution to deal with boundary effects Plots num_of_agents agents</li>
						<li><b>practical4_model.py - </b>	Records times for model to run for different numbers of agents using perf_counter and magnitudes_of_agents Defines distance_between function, eliminating duplicate testing between agents ****EXTRA plots num_of_agents against time taken for model to run ****EXTRA prints minimum and maximum distance between agents</li>
						<li><b>Practical5_model_xy.py -</b> Creates agents using Agent class in agentframework.py num_of_agents created and added to agents container agents move num_of_iterations iterations</li>
						<li><b>Practical5_Agentframework_xy -</b>	each agent has (y,x) between [0,100] randomly generated move behviour added to Agent class - (y,x) move +/-1 randomly protects variable using _x and _y sets up property() attribute for x and y</li>
						<li><b>Practical6_model_xy.py uses csv -</b>	reader to import in.txt raster file into environment ****EXTRA sets x and y possible dimensions same as environment pass environment into each agent when it is created eat() called for each agent after move() ****EXTRA environment written out to environment_eaten.txt at the end agents_stores.txt created with total amount stored by all the agents on a line, appended for each time model runs ****EXTRA appends total of all agents stores to all_agents_stores_total.txt</li>
						<li><b>Practical6_Agentframework_xy -</b>	pass environment variable into Agent constructor ****EXTRA passes x_dimension and y_dimenson into constructor function Create store for each agent with starting value = 0 define eat() for sheep to eat 10 if environment >=10 at its location str(self) overriden to display coordinates and store else added to eat() so agents eat last bits without leaving negative values ****EXTRA if added to eat() for agent(sheep) to be sick if store >100</li>
						<li><b>practical7_model.py -</b>	all agents contain list of all other agents Added neighbourhood variable - defines distance within share_with_neighbour is called Shuffles agent order before each iteration to prevent model artifacts adds in sysargv arguments to run from command line setting num_of_iterations, num_of_agents and neighbourhood from command line call note practical7_model.html generated with sysargv commented out due to issue with pydoc running</li>
						<li><b>practical7_Agentframework.py -	</b>Create distance_between() method to define distance between 2 agents Create share_with_neighbour method - if distance between 2 agents &lt; neighbourhood then both stores set to the average of both stores</li>
						<li><b>practical8_model.py -	</b>Plots the agents after each iteration using update() function within FuncAnimation defines generator function gen_function() to use as frames argument gen_function() uses 2 stopping conditions - carry_on and num_of_iterations carry_on set to false when all sheep have eaten at least 300 Removed code writing agent stores to agents_stores.txt, environment_eaten.txt and all_agents_stores_total.txt</li>
						<li>practical8_Agentframework.py 	no updates</li>
						</ul>
